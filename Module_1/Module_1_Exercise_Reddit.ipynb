When Bella sleeps on top of Edward is it like the cool side of the pillow that eventually matches her body temperature, or are the vampires Ice Cold and always working towards that? The sheer description as being colder than ice (when Bella breaks a knuckle on Jacobs face) would lead one to believe that their bodies work to maintain that or else they would be room temperature, except that would mean so many instances where they touch would be so uncomfortable. You get skin burns from touching ice for twenty minutes and you\\'re telling me Bella f*cked negative temp icicle dick and didn\\'t freezer burn her coochie?

       "   'selftext': 'Doing a monthly rewatch (which I normally rent) but they’re free on amazon prime right now! \\n\\nCurrently watching the first one, extended version. A couple notes \\n\\n1. I find it so interesting the intense hues they chose for each movie. The blue/cool tone in the first really sets the mood for each scene. \\n\\n2. Why is it that when jasper meets Bella at the house for the first time, his eyes are red, in visible pain and they make the joke “he’s our newest vegetarian”. He literally goes to school daily surrounded by other humans and he’s...fine?? \\n\\n3. In the scene where Rosalie breaks the glass bowl and makes the comment “she should know what happens if this ends badly” to which Bella replies “I’ll become the meal” it’s actually funny to see Rosalie fighting back a smile sneakily. \\n\\n4. The scene between Esmé and Carlisle is actually adorable, after they meet Bella. It really intensifies how they are a great pair. \\n\\n5. “Spider monkey” lmao. \\n\\nAnyways in conclusion I love these stupid movies 🥺',\n",

Dakota and Michael Sheen’s acting in New Moon in particular was absolutely phenomenal. I think Michael perfectly captuted the twitchy yet (falsely) gracious and *very* excited auroa of Aro. Extremely entertaining to watch. \\n\\nDakota portrays Jane with the subtle pompousity that she exudes in the novels. She’s perfectly prim with just the right amount of menance and yearning (when she realizes Bella is immune to her powers). She demands respect effortlessly.',\n",

Within the next week or 2 I’m going to start on a personal project, it’s going to be drawing the characters how I imagined them when I read the books.\\nIt’s going to be some digital paintings.

If the I get positive feedback and if I personally feel like I’ve done my best, I’ll keep doing more characters. I have already compiled all of the descriptions I can of the characters I’m currently planning (Bella, Edward, Jacob, the other Cullens) and I’m doing a reread of the first book and bookmarking pages that really trigger the mental images of the characters. \\nI’m getting into digital art, so this is a way for me to really practice and try to sharpen my skills and brush up on art knowledge. I really want to make them look realistic and like real people. I’m not going to be going full body, I’m probably just going to be doing from the chest up/or even shoulders up. I’m still deciding. \\n\\nI’ll keep updating if you guys end up liking it. \\nSorry for the long post, I’m just so excited and probably nobody in my real life would care about this haha\\nI know you guys will be supportive and we all love Twilight ❤️\\n\\nIf you guys have anything you want to say/add/any tips, leave a comment please 🥺\\n\\nI’m not a pro I’m just an amateur, so I’ll do my best and take my time.

       "   'selftext': \"I will probably sleep to this not sure yet but I just want to pause for a second here and say that the score for New Moon is amazing.  At the time the movie came out I was part of  my HS string orchestra and it just made everything so much more connected. I love listening to it on its own, and then watching the movie and waiting for a certain part of a piece. Other times I just watch and kind of sit there thinking about how it really tied the whole movie together and really helped with the atmosphere/character. Alexandre Desplat did such an amazing job, like there are scenes I remember and it'll be because of the piece and just whoa it's just really good!! I also remember when I found out he was composing for HP7 and 8 and feeling relieved that the ending would be in good hands (not that there was ever any worry). I liked Carter Burwell's work on the first movie, that really went well with the atmosphere of the movie for sure but New Moon...wow. It was an absolutely different atmosphere, which makes sense given the change in director and team and all. I think things died down for me before the third movie came out so I never took the time to listen to it or anything after, but as I'm rewatching the movies now, I think I will. Anyway I would love to hear other people's thoughts!\",\n",

Edward shuts down the line of thinking, reminding her of Carlisle's philosophy. Turning her would not be helpful either, as a week old newborn would only hinder their side. Changing the subject, Edward jokes that Bella should challenge Emmett to a wrestling match once she is turned, since she is so worried about newborns being stronger than them. \\n\\nBella calls Jacob and sets up a time to go to Quileute Reservation so that the Cullens can go to hunt. Bella make it through her final exams, and Edward drops her off at the border line as before. Jacob is exhausted - he has been running double shifts guarding Charlie's house since Sam doesn't trust the Cullens enough to send other pack members to relieve him.\\n\\nBella invites Jacob to the graduation party, and tells him that she won't be changing immediately as she had planned. Jacob falls asleep, and Bella takes the time to think through everything. She decides Edward was right - she wasn't ready. She was ready to be with Edward forever, but not to leave her human life behind. And she wanted Edward to turn her - to belong to him in a tangible way, to know that he had chosen her forever, to the extent that he was choosing to have his venom be the one in her veins. \\n\\nWhile considering what it would be like to tell her friends and family she was getting married, Jacob wakes up. Embarrassed that he had wasted so much of their time, Jacob pulls Bella out to the beach, and confesses his love for her. Bella rejects this, telling him she cares for him like family, and when he attempts to caress her cheek she slaps him away. Jacob grabs her by the chin, and forcefully kisses her as she tries to pull away. Finally, Bella shuts down, standing there with her eyes open as she disassociates from the event. \\n\\nWhen he stops, Bella is able to gather her wits enough to punch him as hard as she can. This breaks the knuckles in Bella hand. Jacob shows absolutely no remorse as he drives Bella home. He taunts Bella, telling her she had kissed back and clearly accepted his advances, when she had actually gone into a trauma headspace. At Charlies, Jacob refuses to leave, walking Bella in as she goes to get ice and call Edward to bring her to Carlisle. Jacob tells Charlie what he did, and Charlie laughs, supporting Jacob. \\n\\nBella calls Edward, tells him to come get her, and that she wants him to hurt Jacob for her since her punch clearly didn't work. Bella tells him that Jacob kissed her, and the line cut off at the sound of the Volvo accelerating. Charlie tells Jacob to leave to avoid a fight, but he refuses. \\n\\nEdward gets there, and comforts Bella, checking her hand and helping her calm down from the trauma headspace she was lingering in. In a velvety voice filled with poison, Edward tells Jacob that he won't be killing her yet - he is waiting for Bella to give the order when in her right mind. But if he ever attempts to kiss Bella without her consent again, he will not hesitate to shatter Jacobs jaw as Bella makes up her mind as to his death sentence. \\n\\nThey make it to the Cullen home, and to Carlisle. Emmett teases Bella about starting a fight with a werewolf, but sobers when he learns why. Bella learns about the bet between Emmett and Jasper about how many times she will slip up and kill when she is turned, and it sends Bella into a tailspin. She knows that Edward will keep her from doing something she will regret, but if she wants to do it, is she really her? She starts to question her desires, and the things she wants most before she turns. \\n\\nThe day of graduation, Bella laments having nothing to wear, when Alice appears with a garment box. In talking to Alice, Bella puts two and two together. Her thief is from Seattle. The newborns were in need of her scent. The vampire wasn't just curious, they had a plan. They decide to keep her discovery secret from the rest of the family until after graduation. Bella quickly changes into the blue designer sweater and skirt Alice had gotten her, and gets into the back of the cruiser with Edward as Charlie drives them to graduation. Edward can feel how tense she is, but she tells him it is just nerves. \\n\\nJessica thanks Bella profusely for the party invite, not knowing Alice had sent an invite to every member of the graduating class, and Bella is grateful for the ability to end things with Jessica on a good note. Eric, as acting valedictorian, gives his speech, and Bella comes to terms with the end of her human education. She walks to pick up her diploma, and sees Charlie, Billy Black, and Jacob cheering for her. \\n\\nAlice had left the second she had picked up her diploma, and Bella asks Edward what Alice had been doing to keep him out of her head, blowing their cover. Bella explains her reasoning to Edward, sending him into a tailspin. Bella goes to eat with Charlie, and Edward leaves to talk to the family before the party. Bella sits through the dinner, hiding food to keep Charlie from noticing her inability to eat, as he socializes with the other parents. Bella goes out to the cruiser as Charlie pays, and Edward immediately grabs her to his chest. They kiss and comfort each other for a few short moments before Charlie comes out to drive Bella to the Cullen house, not knowing that Edward is running alongside them.\\n\\nCharlie and Bella share a calm moment of connection as they drive through the fairy light studded driveway to the Cullen house. Regardless of his bad behavior, Bella loves Charlie and doesn't want to hurt him. He attempts to give her advice on how to handle the difficult decisions that come with adult life, and tells her how proud he is to have her as his daughter. Choked up, Bella tells Charlie that the best decision she ever made was moving to Forks, and she exits the cruiser, walking toward the Cullen House where it is lit from the inside. \\n\\n**FUNCTIONAL FACTOID** \\\\- I am taking this week to examine Bella's reaction to her assault, and how Fight, Flight, and Freeze work. Bella clearly exhibits all three in the span of two pages - [this](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/jr/trauma/p3.html) reading can help you understand some of these biological reflexes, and why the questioning of a victims response to assault can be so dangerous to their mental health.\\n\\n**SUBREDDIT QUESTIONS OF THE WEEK** \\\\- Take this week to talk about Jacob and the assault. How do you feel about his behavior up to this point, and during the assault? How do you feel about Charlies response? Edwards? How do you feel about how Meyer wrote Bella's experience of the trauma? Victim blaming and trauma policing will not be allowed, but this is the place to let out your feelings about this situation. If you are waiting for the Jasper discussion, know that it will be coming next week when the pack joins forces with the Cullens and Jasper starts teaching them how to handle newborns.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So we are all obviously excited for *Midnight Sun*, but as a designer who obsesses over certain decisions, I\\'m feeling a little anxious. Why you ask? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBecause the original four Twilight Saga books are formatted in a certain way:\\n\\n1.) They use the old Little, Brown logo. The logo has changed since *Breaking Dawn*\\'s publication in 2008 and the new one will most likely be used.\\n\\n2.) The original saga measure 5.5 x 8.25 inches (or 13.8 x 21 centimeters; both paperback and hardcover) and the dimensions have changed on Little, Brown\\'s hardcovers. According to Amazon\\'s dimensions, *Midnight Sun* measures 6.6 x 9.4 inches (or 16.8 x 23.9 centimeters). On the Twilight Saga part of my book shelf, *Midnight Sun* is going to be a taller book and look out of place.\\n\\n3.) Other formatting concerns: \\n\\n* The title text on the front *Midnight Sun* is so much larger and looks like the title is trying to SCREAM at you, I hope the pomegranate is also on the spine above the text like the first four books and the dust jacket flaps are that deep red (almost maroon-ish) with the same formatting for the book\\'s blurb and Stephenie\\'s author bio. Also, I hope a quote is kept on the back in all white text with a large drop cap and a secondary quote on the first flap before the blurb. \\n* And I hope there\\'s still contents with the chapter numbers and titles and page numbers in the same fonts along with the main chapter titles and first line of chapter text being formatted in Adobe Garamond Pro Small Caps Old.\\n* The title page of the book has a grey image background and the pages have the ornaments on both sides and there\\'s no headers with Miss Meyer\\'s name or \"Midnight Sun\".\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBasically ***REALLY*** I hope *Midnight Sun* is formatted the same as the rest of the Twilight Saga.

       "   'selftext': 'I’m rereading for the first time since like 2009- currently at the start of Eclipse and honestly barely remember the plot which is nice because it’s like I’m reading it for the first time.. there’s obviously been some arguing between Edward and Bella about her becoming a vampire. I’ve always been on Bella’s “side” that it’s her choice and I think Edward is really stubborn about the whole thing. \\n\\nThis time around, I kinda am reading that Bella is sorta jumping into it. I think the Volturi argument is completely sound. But I still feel like she doesn’t *get* it entirely and should be more scared, maybe even sort of dreading the change, but knowing ultimately it will have to happen and she does want Forever with Edward. \\n\\nAnyway, back to the point of this post. Has Bella ever brought up the possible reverse scenario? If Edward was the human, Bella the vampire, would Edward really care about his “soul”? Would he really choose to stay human instead? I know he has all the years under his belt of being a vampire and believes he’s a monster or whatever but.. this is a love story and if the roles were reversed, I think he’d want to be a vampire just as much as she does so they can spend together forever. \\n\\nAnd would he really let her grow old? Would he turn her on her death bed? If not, wouldn’t it be terrible to watch her die, knowing she could’ve lived forever instead? He can’t keep her safe from *everything*, so why risk it? She could be struck by lightning or get cancer or driving alone and get into a terrible car accident. \\n\\nThe request of waiting five years is reasonable. Even 10 I could understand.. but why is he *so* against it? If he had it his way, she’d die a human, but why? When it’s obviously not what she wants? \\n\\nMaybe this gets discussed more in this book as she doesn’t change til the next one. I really barely remember the specifics. It’s just tough reading them have this same argument over and over and feeling frustrated, knowing it turns out different than they both want anyway.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The backstory is sorta important but I\\'ll leave a TLDR at the bottom.\\n\\nIve recently started rewatching the movies with my mom (it\\'s her first time ever seeing them) we just finished eclipse today and so far she seems pretty team Jacob. I don\\'t really categorize myself as team Edward or Jacob (I think they\\'d both be great friends but personally don\\'t find either too romantically appealing) but I do think that Jacob has done some manipulative things, such as today when we were watching eclipse i stated that I thought it was manipulative of Jake to say that maybe he should just get himself killed to \"make the choice easier\" for bella because bella had already told him multiple times she didn\\'t want to pursue a romantic relationship with him in both new moon and eclipse before this and he most likey knew she would feel bad and ask him to kiss her. Well mom said that bella has done some stuff that could have led him to believe that he had a chance and she should just make a choice even though i pointed out already that she has stated multiple times she doesn\\'t want to be with Jake like that. Anyways mom was asking me if I had to make a choice between the two and I said Edward because Jake has displayed some manipulative behavior and she argued that Edward has too he\\'s just better at hiding it and I agreed, but now that I\\'m thinking about it I really can\\'t think of too many specific examples of him displaying such behavior. \\n\\n(TLDR) Anyways I guess my question is, do you guys think Edward is manipulative or has done manipulative things? \\n\\nBy the way I don\\'t hate or have anything against Jake I just think he\\'s made some poor decisions when trying to romantically pursue bella. I think he\\'s been a great friend to her and I understand he\\'s a bit younger than her and probably has less experience with this sort of stuff I just don\\'t particularly care for some of his behavior.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I'm sorry but I gotta speak my mind about this. \\n\\nSome people have been posting memes about Robert Pattinson being angry because he might have to come back filming another Twilight movie. Those are kinda funny, but in no way realistic.\\n\\nFirst of all the first movie was in cinemas on janurary 16th 2009 - which is more than eleven(!) years ago. And Rob, who was 22/23 whilest filming, was already to old to play Edward. So although that man aged like a fine wine, he is way too old to play a seventeen year old vampire (again). But then it's not just him, obviously the whole cast aged too much to play 17-26 year old vampires.\\n\\nBut lets say they would gather a new cast: I think it wouldn't be interesting enaugh. Like yeah the family-dynamics between the Cullens might be great to watch on a big screen (if we ignore the wierdness they all are dating another familymember). But aside of that there wouldn't happen something new since we know what Edward had been going whilest not beeing on Bellas side. Also Edward stalking Bella for two thirds of a movie wouldn't do anything for anyone.\\n\\nSo reading the same book (which has esentially the same story for the third time over) from another perspective, might be interesting. But It wouldn't make much sense if they were to make another movie out of it.\\n\\nSorry for my rant. (Also I hope I did okay, grammar-wise)\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Positive and negative things here. I know a lot of us are re-reading before the Midnight Sun release, so I\\'m curious what else is coming up for other people, too!\\n\\nAm I the only one saddened by the fact that we spend the entirety of Bella\\'s pregnant weeks with Jacob? I really don\\'t like Jacob, so part of my discontent is definitely caused by that, but Bella has such fierce love for her unborn baby and I wish we could\\'ve gotten a glimpse into that. This read through I felt like her post-change feeling of loss because her daughter is suddenly separate from her and even some of the fierce protection she has for Renesmee isn\\'t well earned because we never feel the urgency and selflessness with which she protects her daughter before she\\'s born. I think we get that more in the films because we really see her battle it out with everyone to protect her baby, so much so that Edward unleashes a lot of anger and fear on her (in a rare scene for this franchise where Rob is actually truly great). I wish that was in the book more. \\n\\nActually, a bunch of my favorite scenes from the movies I now remember aren\\'t in the book at all: the Volturi fight scene, the scene mentioned above, Edward apologizing to Bella for leaving her alone in her sacrifices, Bella telling Renesmee what the words on the locket mean, Edward apologizing to Bella for underestimating her constantly, Edward thanking Carlisle for his life (makes me tear up).\\n\\nAnd there are moments that are in the book that I wish they\\'d snuck in to the movies: Edward\\'s line to Bella about getting everything he wanted plus things he didn\\'t even think to ask for, all the subconscious touching between them that happens in the battle scene, Edward refusing to teach Bella how to fight because he couldn\\'t bare imagining her being attacked, Renesmee\\'s curls, a lot of Edward\\'s humor in the far and few between light moments...\\n\\nAnd of course there are changes/consistencies that happened between book and movies that I love: that they power through the beautifully awkward post-sex argument with so much pain and confusion and embarrassment and hurt, the pre-sex shaving scene, the Bella/Jacob scene at the wedding, Bella figuring out that she\\'s pregnant, the set up and delivery of that (one) great line of Jacob\\'s: \" it wasn\\'t an idea, it was a snide comment,\" Bella asking her dad not to let her fall before walking down the aisle, BELLA SAYING GOODBYE TO HER DAD after the wedding, the synthesis of the J Jenkins scenes into one heartbreaking moment, Edward seeing human, pregnant Bella being undressed to shower and basically disintegrating in pain, the casting of Mackenzie to play their daughter, Bella crying after her dream on the island, etc.\\n\\nAlso, although I\\'ve never really wished to read Edward\\'s perspective for any of the books except Twilight before, this time through Breaking Dawn, there were a few scenes that I realized I\\'d LOVE to read from his perspective: watching Bella\\'s ribs break and her body waste away, hearing their daughter for the first time and the thought behind his line (paraphrasing) \"I thought he\\'d be like me, but he\\'s good like you,\" holding their daughter for the first time, seeing Bella as a vampire for the first time, just the pure joy in the middle of having a family he never dreamed of having, finally, finally getting to marry Bella (after picturing her marrying someone else causes him to realize his love for her overpowered his thirst for her), touching her for the first time after she\\'s a vampire, just him being in awe of her on a whole new level throughout the last couple chapters, the absolute thrill he must get every single time he calls her his wife, HEARING HER. \\n\\nWhich brings me to the (near) end of my musings. I\\'ll never argue that Stephenie is any talented author of literature. But after chapters full of new fantastical characters and lengthy discussions about vampire gifts and the intricacies of all the creatures and how different relationships and loyalties and laws work in this fantastical world, her choice to end the whole franchise by bringing us finally back to a quiet, peaceful scene just between our two leads, and to use that scene to give poor Edward the one thing he\\'s always wanted the most in the world is so dang beautiful and so satisfyingly full circle that it\\'s brilliant. (Although I strongly dislike the last two of lines in the book and actively pretend they don\\'t exist...). Such a perfect choice to remind us with this scene that everything that happened in every single book was all just because these two fools simply refused to stop loving each other...\\n\\nAnd lastly, because any discussion of any book or movie would be incomplete without mentioning it: Charlie Swan is a legend and my hero.',\n",

Reading this when I was in 8th grade, I would have shook my head and mentally reprimanded her for structuring her life around her boyfriend; developing  a personality centered around the love of your life and then breaking up with that person would leave anybody in shambles.

       "   'selftext': '# Note: This discussion will deal with Jasper Hale and his background as a confederate soldier before being turned. Please be civil.\\n\\nApologies for the delay this week, my professional writing had to take the front seat for a deadline\\n\\n**MARGARET\\'S REVIEW** \\\\- Edward meets Bella, and they head into the party. The Cullens are putting together the final touches for Alice\\'s extravaganza as almost every student from Forks High begins to arrive. Bella finds her rhythm in pretending with the rest of the family - she might not like being the center of attention, but there was a system to using that attention as a distraction. \\n\\nWith the party in full swing, Alice has a vision. Bella rushes over to her as the doorbell rings. Jacob has arrived, with Quil and Embry. Alice rushes off to find Carlisle to tell him what she had seen, leaving Bella in the dark as she is forced to handle the boys. Bella tries to get away from them by disappearing into the crowd, but Jacob pulls her into a deserted corner of the room. Jacob guilts Bella into accepting his apology for his assault, and gives her a silver bracelet with a hand carved wolf charm. \\n\\nJacob notices how distracted Bella is, and realizes something is happening with the family that he doesn\\'t know. The boys pin Bella in against the wall, insisting she share what she knows, and Alice comes to extract her from the situation. The boys block both girls in, and Jasper appears out of nowhere, silent as he stands between them and Bella. Still trapped in the corner, with Jasper unable to act without making the hundreds of humans in the room acutely aware that they were in a home filled with supernatural beings, Alice tells Bella what she saw. \\n\\nThe army is coming to Forks. With the absolute intention of finding Bella, and killing her. The time for the Cullens to go to Seattle to handle it has passed, and now the danger is going to be quite literally in their backyard. Putting the pieces together, Jacob volunteers the pack as allies to protect the town, and Bella. Horrified, Bella tries to stop them as Jasper sets up a training session for everyone that night. \\n\\nAt the end of the party, Edward takes Bella home. The rest of the family is relieved, confidant that with the wolves on their side they will defeat the army. Bella is terrified, as both sides of her community, her family and her friends, put themselves on the line to defend her. Bella insists on going to the training session, wanting to at least provide moral support if she can\\'t fight herself. \\n\\nEdward attempts to comfort Bella by telling her that the wolves tip the scales so severely that there won\\'t be enough carnage to go around. This does nothing to assuage Bella\\'s fear, and they head to the same field where the family had previously played baseball in Book 1, where James Victoria and Laurent had first entered the picture. With Victoria on her mind, Bella puts together the final puzzle piece.\\n\\nThe army coming for her isn\\'t on order of the Volturi, but Victoria. A revenge plot. Having spent time in Southern North America while running from Edward in New Moon, she had picked up a thing or two, and had decided to wield it against Bella, not knowing Jasper would recognize the pattern. Bella puts this all together, but Edward isn\\'t sure, still believing that the Volturi are the more likely option. \\n\\nThe Cullens wait for the pack, in a rare moment of family unity. Everyone is in the field, and they are all focused on the same goal - protecting Bella. Unlike Twilight, there are no dissenting opinions. There is no question that they will protect her, and are keenly focused on the task at hand. The pack arrives, and Jasper begins his lesson.\\n\\nJasper is a quick yet strict teacher - his years of experience heading the army click back in to place, and he is swift with corrections, but never cruel. Jasper is quite clearly in his element, and Edward is hypnotized by it, to the concern of Bella. She had never seen the family fight before, having been much too out of it in Twilight to pay attention to James\\' death, and watching the grace with which they practiced fatal attacks was disarming. \\n\\nJasper senses Bella\\'s fear, and calls Alice up. He sends a wave of comfort Bella\\'s way as he proves to her that Alice can defend herself - while Jasper would never actually hurt Alice, he slips into \\'Major\\' mode and goes for the attack, which Alice is able to easily parry. The fight nearly seemed a dance, perfectly choreographed by his attacks and her gentle avoidance. Finally, Alice jumped on Jaspers back, declaring herself the winner as Bella exhaled for the first time since they had began. Edward lept up for his turn as Alice came to sit next to Bella, in the guise of comfort.\\n\\nOnce Edward is distracted, Alice pulls Bella\\'s attention from the fight with a deep and low whisper. Alice had seen Bella\\'s vaguely formulating plans to pull the target to her in the fight rather than the family, and she will not allow it. Part of this very public demonstration was to show Bella that they could handle themselves - her putting herself in greater danger would only make it harder for everyone. \\n\\nJasper and Edward call it a draw, having been so evenly matched neither could get the upper hand. They continue on deep into the night, with each member of the family taking a turn as the pack watch on in silence. Finally, on the verge of sunrise, they stop for the night, with everyone agreeing to begin again the next night. The wolves come to the center of the clearing to become familiar with the scent of each member of the family, so as to seperate them from the other vampires on the battlefield. Bella is able to really see Jacob in his wolf form for the first time, and is almost giddy to find him inside of the shape that had been haunting her nightmares since Laurent\\'s death. The rest of the pack leaves, and Jacob phases back to human, to discuss where Bella will be during the battle. \\n\\nThe realization that the army is coming on Saturday hits Bella by surprise - the same day she had bought Alice and Edward tickets to the concert in Seattle. She decides to give them to Angela and Ben, to get them out of Forks in case something went wrong. Keeping Bella safe is a much harder problem to solve. She clearly cannot be in Forks, and the newborns would have no problem crossing into La Push for her, putting the entire tribe at risk, as all of the wolves would be at the battle. The strategy they decide upon is to hide her deep in the Olympic Mountains - Jacob will carry her to the place, masking her scent in his, which would put off any of the newborns from smelling too closely. A false trail of Bella scent will be put in place as well, leading the newborns directly to the field where the Cullens and the Quileute will be waiting. Seth would stay with Bella in the mountains as her \\'guard dog\\', and would be able to communicate with the rest of the pack through their mind link. Should something go awry, he could tell the pack, and Edward would be able to pick the message out of their minds and run to her aid. \\n\\nThe plan in place, Edward takes Bella home, the sun peeking over the horizon. His energy is light, confident, and prepared, in contrast to Bella, who is nauseous at the thought of so many people at risk on her behalf. But what bothers her the most, what she cannot get out of her head, is the image of Jasper crouched in front of Edward. Of Edward on the defensive, the one in the crosshairs. Bella fitfully goes to sleep, and does not wake up until the late afternoon. \\n\\nEdward comments on the hand carved bracelet from Jacob that Bella is still wearing, hurt that he can give her presents, but Edward cannot. Bella acquises to accepting a hand me down that Edward promises to deliver in the future. Their banter is interrupted by Alice, calling to warn Edward - Bella was still wanting to pull the danger toward herself, and Alice refused to let it happen. Edward isn\\'t surprised, having heard something similar in Bella\\'s sleep babble. Bella likes Jasper\\'s fleeting idea of having her in the clearing - with her so close, the newborns would be falling over themselves, and even easier to kill. Jasper himself had shut it down the night before, but Bella liked it - at least she wouldn\\'t be in the dark as to what was happening during the battle. Edward vehemently refuses the idea, and distracts her with the fact that Leah Clearwater had transformed, the first female wolf to the pack\\'s knowledge. \\n\\nAs they lightly discuss the pack drama Edward had picked up that night, an idea takes shape in Bella\\'s head. If she can\\'t be in the clearing with Edward, she wanted Edward in the mountains with her. She knew it was selfish, and the guilt immediately overwhelmed her, but she couldn\\'t stand worrying about Edward, knowing that there were people actively trying to kill him because of her. To ask nearly chokes her, and Edward is almost paralyzed by the request, but when he sees how utterly desperate she is to remain at his side, he agrees, and tells the family he will be staying with her in the mountains. \\n\\nEdward calls Alice to come by to watch Bella so he can talk to Jasper, and the two stand in the kitchen, holding each other for a long while. Edward eventually breaks the silence by asking Bella about the Third Wife - she had been muttering her name in her sleep. Bella avoids the question as Alice arrives, not wanting Edward to know the depth of her self sacrifice fantasies. \\n\\nAlice plays Charlie like a fiddle, and gets his permission to have Bella \"spend the weekend\" with her, so that Bella doesn\\'t have to play the ignorant human charade while preparing for the battle. When Edward arrives that night, everything sorted with the family, Bella asks him to prepare her for what this round of a sleepover with Alice would entail - laughing, Edward corrects her. Charlie might think Alice is going to be the one with her Friday night, but in reality she and the rest of the family would be hunting in preparation for the battle. Instead, Bella and Edward would have the Cullen house to themselves. \\n\\nAt that nights training, Bella fights to swallow her fear for everyone, and Jacob comforts her in wolf form. Quietly, she realizes that he is much more the kind boy she had befriended in the beginning of New Moon when phased than human these days, and she takes the moment of peace as she stares up at the night sky, searching for answers. \\n\\n**FUNCTIONAL FACTOID** \\\\- [THIS](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-jun-27-la-ca-working-20100627-story.html) interview from 2010 discusses the difficulty the film\\'s fight coordinator had in capturing the elegant brutality of the Cullen\\'s training sessions. It took a blend of parkour, gymnastics, and precision jumping to achieve the affect, in combination with wire and CGI work. \\n\\n**SUBREDDIT QUESTIONS OF THE WEEK** \\\\- How do you feel about Jasper as a character outside of his confederate affiliation? How do you feel about Stephanie\\'s decision to make a footnote of his story his confederate affiliation? Do you believe a vampire such as Jasper would be permanently tied to such beliefs, having been turned when he was, or do you think it is possible for him to grow past them? How do you wish the situation had been handled in the series? How do you feel about the Southern Vampire Wars, and Maria? What are your thoughts on this training session? Drop your thoughts on Jasper in this week\\'s discussion.',\n",

Edward in my personal opinion doesn't love Bella, but just the idea of her. Re-watching the whole thing, I've come to the conclusion the idea of a girl not scared of you and willing to do anything is perfect, but Edward expects Bella to just sit still and look pretty so she doesn't end up with Mr.Wolf (( Jacob )) and expects her respect. \\n2. Edward and Bella's relationship can only be summed up of sex. Literally every scene is almost kissing, sex or fighting. Even with a baby they have sex. (( Who is in the next room ))\\n3. Edward tries to keep Bella away from her friends and isolates her. This can be seen as Bella sits at the Collin's table and watches her friends from a distance and acts weird around them. She doesn't act weird around anyone else because she actually talks to them. Like the Collins. Who Edward doesn't isolate her from. \\n\\nJACOB\\n\\n1.

       "   'selftext': 'Ok I think I\\'m ready to post my thoughts now. \\n\\nSO\\n\\nThe first thing that I realized watching the movie was the amount of people that were ...well ...everywhere: the school, the town in general. I was surprised as how, as I read the books, never really pictured anyone else besides the characters with a name, even though I knew that schools are always full of people lol. So that was a shock. \\n\\nI really liked Anna Kendrick as Jessica, she\\'s funny. Mike was ok and Angela and Eric were different from what I imagined, but they were ok? Also, what was with Eric and the animals? First the worm, then the snake? That was just ???\\n\\nOk, the acting IS weird. And I don\\'t know why is that. Kristen and Rob are great actors so I\\'m just going to blame the direction because their interactions are extremely awkward (except for some moments that are just 😍). I mean, I know that Bella is awkward, but the awkwardness that I saw was.... off-putting and that makes me MAD because they CAN act, so what was the problem then???\\n\\nSo, halfway through the movie I started feeling nauseous and I couldn\\'t believe that it was because the movie was being awful, fortunately, it wasn\\'t because of that. It was because of the camera movements!!! Those 360° turns that went on again and again and again made me dizzy! By this time I was just annoyed at the direction SMH.\\n\\nBut THEN I saw CARLISLE!!!! Ok, when I saw the pictures of the cast, I didn\\'t like Carlisle\\'s actor. But OMG, the minute I saw him in the movie, I fell in love. He\\'s a ZADDY, and I just love him so much. Also, Charlie???? The acting of that man is GREAT! (and his also a zaddy, don\\'t @ me for being a thirsty bitch)\\n\\nRANT:\\nNow, the screenplay? Honestly, who did that? I mean, you already had the script right there in the book, and yet it was the worst part of the movie? I\\'m not a writer ok? But I\\'m a consumer of the movie and I\\'m going to critic it. It was plain AWFUL. I felt like I wouldn\\'t have been able to understand what was going on if I didn\\'t know what the story was about beforehand. To me it was just a scrappy dialogue. Lines from the book where squeezed in between dialogues and felt like they came out of nowhere. It would\\'ve been better to have a script written from scratch that captured the essence of the scenes rather than just picking up dialogues from the book and reduce them so much to the point that they don\\'t make sense anymore. In fact, the best scenes/dialogues/lines imo where the ones that weren\\'t even in the book, in particular:\\n\\n1. The scene in Port Angeles where Bella and Edward are in the restaurant. The part when Bella said \"I need answers\" and Edward says \"yes, no, to get to the other side\" I LOVED THAT \\n2. When Bella arrives to the Cullen\\'s house and they are COOKING for her ughhhh SO HEARTWARMING\\n3. The scene where Bella is leaving the house in a hurry after the baseball game and Charlie tells her to not leave, that they can spend more time together and Bella says \"doing what? Watching TV and eating burgers everyday?\" (or something along the lines) SO HEART WRENCHING (also my boy Charlie NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS)\\n\\nRANT END\\n\\nAlso, why are the effects so bad? Where they always this bad? Or when the movie premiered they were good? (when you watch movies that just came out is like \"wow the effects are so good\" but then you watch them again after a couple of years and is like????) So someone please tell me if the effect were once considered good.\\n\\nEDWARD SMILES. That\\'s it.\\nJK. I always thought Edward had that pained expression the whole movie but I was wrong. HE SMILES and whenever he smiled I smiled too, and that was such a pleasant surprise, because in the books Edward smiles all the time (\"the crooked smile\"), and yes, he\\'s serious and is conflicted but he also knows how to enjoy himself lol\\n\\nWHY IS BILLY BLACK DRIVING A CAR IF HIS PARALYZED??????\\n\\nTHE BASEBALL SCENE. Yes, I enjoyed it. Alice throwing the ball 😍😍😍😍😍 and Jasper with the bat 😍😍😍😍 also I couldn\\'t help but notice Rosalie trying to do the same cool thing with the bat like Jasper but failing horribly lmao. But it was weird when they crouched to defend Bella 😂.\\n\\nI don\\'t like the lullaby, and it was always playing in the background and I did NOT LIKE IT. River flows in you will always be the lullaby to me ok?\\n\\nI liked that the scene in the ballet studio wasn\\'t as prolonged as in the book (I don\\'t like when the villains talk about their plans and their dreams or whatever instead of just doing the killing) and I really liked James, the acting was believable which was refreshing to see lol. Also I loved the song Rob sings during the climax of the scene lol. Something I realized is that they don\\'t really explain how the bite fits in the whole \"Bella fell downstairs and out a window\" story (and neither does the book?) \\n\\nTaylor acting wasn\\'t bad (I thought it was going to be because I read that somewhere) and I liked the final prom scene Rob and Kristen did have chemistry.\\n\\nAll in all it was entertaining, I laughed a lot (and not for the right reasons lol) and the two hours just flew by, but it pained me to see Rob\\'s and Kristen\\'s acting and I can ONLY imagine how it should pain THEM to see the movie. I get you know Rob.\\n\\nSo that\\'s for my review of Twilight lol. I\\'m sure I\\'ve missed a lot but you can comment and ask me what my thoughts are on particular aspects of the movie that you think I missed. \\n\\nTLDR: I ENJOYED IT OK? but I\\'m also kinda annoyed BUT I LOVED IT STILL (does that make sense? IDK)\\n\\nEDIT ( I\\'m adding things as I remember them)\\nIt was a really nice touch to include dozens of graduate caps in the Cullen\\'s house, it made me laugh.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I (F) started reading the books when I was about 16, and shortly after the movies began to come out. I was a big fan and had some merch, and just really liked it.

       "   'selftext': 'Long story ahead, but I am just having some good feelings after a lot of sad ones! So my former best friend and I were obsessed with Twilight. We talked about it every single day; we traded memes and fanfic ideas and even had a Forks vacation a few years ago. Apart from Twilight, we were like family and have been super close for years. Well, she got a girlfriend and they moved in together and to make a long story short, she decided she didn’t need to have another big relationship in her life that required time and work, and told me she didn’t want to talk for a few months, and she hasn’t contacted me since. I am getting married in October and had to change wedding plans because she was going to bake the cake and do a reading. Anyway, it was super hard, and I have stayed away from Twilight because I keep wanting to text her our old jokes and stuff and every time that happens it is like a gut punch. I am feeling a lot better about it overall after the test of my friends helped me see how we had actually not had a good friendship for a long time, and today, after months, I watched the extended edition of Twilight! These movies are so fun, and I just had to get back in to the universe since we are so close to Midnight Sun! It will be hard to read that and not talk about it with her, but I am really glad for this community and having y’all to share that experience with! \\n\\nI know this was rambly, but I just needed to process my way through. Thanks for being here!',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I was made aware of the fact that Stephenie Meyer originally had a whole different cast she wanted for Twilight, with Emily Browning set to play Bella. However we know she was later chosen to start in The Host (Stephenie’s other book) so I guess she must’ve really liked her.\\n\\nWhen looking through google for her a particular movie she starred in caught my attention.\\nIn this movie there is also Cam Giganded (who played James on Twilight) and Xavier Samuel (who played Riley Biers in Twilight). \\nAnd guess what, the movie was made by the director of Twilight.\\nAnd what is this movie called, you ask? “Plush”.\\nWhich reminds me A LOT of “La Push baby, La Push!”\\n\\nAnd the cover for this movie is more Twilight than anything Twilight related will ever be. It’s a pic of these 3 actors scattered as if on pieces of broken glass. The scene with the ballet room with glass walls in Twilight?? Hello??\\n\\nNeedless to say I know nothing of this movie, but with all these Twilight references/crossovers, I can’t help but want to watch it!\\nIt just made me laugh how in-your-face Twilight knock-off it was, and I thought you should all know (if you didn’t already)!\\nPlease seriously though look at the movie cover it’s hilariously Twilight-esque.',\n",

       "   'selftext': '*Today and next week\\'s reviews are going to be somewhat truncated, as we are now going 4 chapters per week to get the reread done before Midnight Sun, and I am having to dedicate a significant amount of time to combing over the film for our traditional Differences end post. If I don\\'t mention a specific detail you want mentioned, PLEASE comment it! These rereads thrive on discussion and you all bringing up points in contrast to mine.*\\n\\n**MARGARET\\'S REVIEW** \\\\- Bella and Edward go to the Cullen household for their anticipated alone time. Edward gives Bella a heart shaped crystal that is a hand me down from his mother, which he attached to her bracelet directly opposite Jacobs hand carved wolf. He does not bother to inform Bella that the crystal is in fact a diamond. Bella is emboldened by their alone time, and decides to press Edward on the one thing she wants before becoming a vampire - to physically consummate their relationship. She is scared that her priorities will be off during the newborn stage, and wants to love him in every way possible before that happens. Edward is aghast, and more than a little bit terrified, but Bella wears him down, promising to let him have whatever he wants - marriage, more time, even to give her more gifts if he will sleep with her. \\n\\nEdward eventually acquises, but only agrees to sleep with Bella after they have been married - thus, making them engaged. Edward proposes with his mothers vintage ring, and is overjoyed at the sight of it on Bella\\'s finger - something that doesn\\'t bother her as much as she thought it would. She is terrified of telling Renee and Charlie, and is convinced everyone at school will think she is pregnant, but Edward\\'s complete and total delight infects her to even get a little excited. She takes off the ring before going to bed, not intending to let others know yet.\\n\\nThe next day is windy and cold. Charlie is safe in La Push with Billy, and Angela and Ben are bundled off to Seattle for the concert, but the rest of Forks is exposed. Alice is perturbed at Bella and Edward entertaining the idea of going to Vegas to get married, and guilt trips the two of them into letting her plan a wedding at the Cullen house. In the woods, on their way to meet Jacob for the path coverage, Bella cuts herself. Edward helps her, and reveals that he is no longer as triggered by the scent of her blood - after believing her to be dead, his body physically revolts at the idea of ever making that thought true again. Jacob picks Bella up, and carries her bridal style to the campground, much to her discomfort. He questions her on the addition to her bracelet, and on if she had thought more about his assault (which he terms their kiss). Annoyed, Jacob claims she likes him better as a wolf because then she doesn\\'t have to pretend not to like him - Bella shoots it down, saying it is because he cannot talk. \\n\\nBella tells Jacob that Edward will be staying with her during the fight, because she asked him too. Jacob scoffs, and tells Bella he would never do that, and that she just needed to get over her fears. Jacob reveals that he is now the second in command of the pack due to his lineage, because he refused to take the position of chief from Sam, although by ancestral lines the Black family ranks above the Uley\\'s. They arrive at the campground, and Jacob decides to send Seth home for the night - instead he will spend the night with Edward and Bella in the tent. \\n\\nIt is not a good night. It is freezing, the wind is howling, and Bella nearly becomes hypothermic. Edward urges her to leave and go home, to start over the next day, but Bella refuses, not wanting to undo all of their plans. Eventually Jacob has to get in her sleeping bag with her to physically warm her with his elevated body temperature. Jacob makes several lewd remarks about the situation before Bella falls asleep, hearing snippets of a conversation between the two boys. Edward reveals to Jacob that he was terrified that by being overbearing, he was pushing Bella into Jacobs arms, hence his sharp shift in attitudes. He partially believes Jacob would be better for her than he is, but that he cannot live without her, and will not leave again until she tells him to. Edward concedes that if they were not mortal enemies, he might like Jacob - Jacob does not agree. \\n\\nWhen Bella wakes, Jake and Edward get into a mild squabble, and Jacob heads out to the fight as Seth arrives. Bella and Edward pass the time by discussing the best nights of their lives, in contrast to the night previous, and their engagement is revealed - Jacob\\'s screams can be heard, and Bella realizes Edward knew Jacob was close enough to overhear. Heartsick, Bella sends Edward to go get Jacob and then stay away - she had wanted to tell Jacob on her own terms. Bella apologizes to Jacob, and promises to stay out of his life forever so that he didn\\'t have to suffer seeing her happy with Edward. Jacob tells her that he is going to intentionally let himself be killed in the battle so that he didn\\'t have to live to see it - Bella is horrified, and Jacob tells her the only way to keep him safe is for her to kiss him. Really kiss him. Horrorstruck, Bella does, and realizes that on some level she is in love with Jacob, after all this time. Jacob leaves for the battle as sobs wrack Bella\\'s body.\\n\\n**FUNCTIONAL FACTOID** \\\\- [The engagement ring](https://www.instyle.com/news/details-bellas-engagement-ring-plus-experts-plan-wedding) was one of the most critical props used in the films, and getting it right was paramount to the props department - in fact, no one saw the ring until the day of filming on set, as they were perfecting it up until a few hours before filming! Do you like the ring? Is it what you envisioned when you were reading the books? If not, how would you change it?\\n\\n**SUBREDDIT QUESTIONS OF THE WEEK** \\\\- What was your reaction when first reading the series the physicality brought into Edward and Bella\\'s relationship in Compromise? What is your reaction now? How do you feel about Bella\\'s \"Please\" tactic? Was the proposal anything like what you had imagined it would be? How do you feel about the whole tent conversation? How do you feel about Edwards concession? Thoughts on Edward intentionally letting Jacob hear about the engagement? Jacob and the Assault. Put your thoughts on it all here - I know you all have them.',\n",

Never getting the chance to obsess, disect, and guess at the secret meaning of everything he says and does?\"\\n\\nAnd I\\'ve wondered if Edward possibly felt the same way??

       "   'selftext': 'I absolutely despised Book Charlie. I think it really started up around New Moon/Eclipse when he started picking up on Jacob being a romantic possibility for Bella, and began to hardcore push her towards him. \\n\\nGood lord I can’t stand his reaction to Jacob forcibly kissing Bella in Eclipse:\\n\\n\\n**”What’s wrong with her?” Charlie wondered.**\\n\\n**“She thinks she broke her hand,” I heard Jacob tell him. I went to the freezer and pulled out a tray of ice cubes.**\\n\\n**“How did she do that?” As my father, I thought Charlie ought to sound a bit less amused and a bit more concerned.**\\n\\n**Jacob laughed. “She hit me.”**\\n\\n**Charlie laughed, too, and I scowled while I beat the tray against the edge of the sink. The ice scattered inside the basin, and I grabbed a handful with my good hand and wrapped the cubes in the dishcloth on the counter.**\\n\\n**“Why did she hit you?”**\\n\\n**“Because I kissed her,” Jacob said, unashamed.**\\n\\n**“Good for you, kid,” Charlie congratulated him.**\\n\\nHoly shit I want to punch him so badly. What an absolute ass of a parent. Your daughter’s hand is broken and you fucking laugh??? Your daughter, who has a boyfriend, was kissed, obviously in a forced way, by someone she considered a friend, and you congratulate him, rather than threaten him with that shotgun you’re always hanging over Edward’s head???\\n\\nIn the books, he’s just so much more out of touch and distanced from Bella. At least in the movies, it’s like they understand how to be on the same wavelength and respect the other’s space, no matter how awkward they may be around each other. Regardless, there’s a solid care behind Movie Charlie’s blank faces that speaks volumes, like in the scene in Twilight where he’s trying to convince Bella to stay, when she’s trying to leave so she can lead James away from Forks, as well as stay safe herself. That was one of the best scenes in that movie. \\n\\nBook Charlie just comes off as relentlessly childish, selfish, and stubborn to an extreme fault. His pouty attitude constantly pushes Bella to her limit, and he never takes her seriously or values her opinion. Yes, New Moon took a huge impact on Bella and it would be rational that any parent would be, at the least, wary of Edward because of it. But the way Charlie handles the situation is just so completely infantile. Literally from Eclipse and onwards, he’s outright just immature around Edward- he doesn’t even try to be collected or calm around him. His smugness irritates me to no end.  And another thing- I really hate the dynamic between Bella and him, how she’s always doing everything for him like laundry and cleaning and cooking. He’s always like “what’s for dinner, Bells?” Like, are you a child? No wonder you wife left you, you never do shit for yourself. 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️\\n\\nAnd I truly, especially hate how he constantly pushes her to hang out with Jacob. I get from a parent’s perspective, it’s partially his right to advise her or encourage her on her social life, but he’s really only pushing her towards Jacob because: he doesn’t want her to be with Edward, he wants to keep the nostalgia in his own mind of them being childhood friends intact, and Jacob is his best friend’s son- so he already has a bias towards him, especially in a meddling parent way.\\n\\nI get that with the books, we’re exposed to Charlie much, much more than we are to Movie Charlie, but even so- I just adore Movie Charlie so much more. Even if you can tell he’s disapproving or unsure of Bella’s choices, you can tell he just wants her to be happy. Book Charlie honestly seems like he couldn’t give a damn about Bella’s happiness as long as her life fits into the little idealistic fantasy he’s imagined for her.\\n\\nFuck you Book Charlie.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Around a decade ago when twilight was at its peak popularity, the books were always stalled out in front of the windows in book stores, and they had tons of copies of every book in the saga. Flash forward to 2020, and I do not know a single book store that sells new twilight books. There was one that had pocket paperbacks of twilight and new moon about half a year ago; but even those are all gone now, and I highly doubt all of them have been bought. It\\'s not just that there is no twilight merch for sale, it\\'s as if the only way to get the actual books is to order online or try your luck in a second hand book store. Whereas for example Harry Potter is being sold literally everywhere, along with incredible amounts of merch even though the original series ended before twilight did.... I wonder why that is? Do people just really not care about twilight anymore and has it now become a niche thing as opposed to how mainstream it used to be? Or could it be a different reason, like parents complaining about the books being a \"bad influence\"? I\\'d like to hear your theories, spider monkey.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So I’ve just done a big brain dump and plan to write this properly soon ....\\nROCKY HORROR TWILIGHT SHOW.\\n\\nAfter years of being alive it’s hard for the Cullens to find things they really enjoy. It’s hard for them to feel part of something as they have to move so frequently. And then one night in 1975 Jasper is out late, he’s been skulking around the city trying to train himself to behave around humans. He turns the corner and in front of him in all its lighted beauty the local cinema. It’s far too late for any regular movie. He looks at the billboard. Something called Rocky Horror Picture Show. He looks at the queue of teenagers waiting to be let in. He looks at their pale make up, the dark eyes, fishnets, heels, and surgical gowns. \\n\\nHe’s never seen anything like this before. Anxious to know more he buys a ticket and settles in along the back row. It’s a struggle for him of course. He could kill the entire theatre in three minutes. But he restrains himself. He focuses on the film but he watches the audience, how they participate how this room of strangers are joined by this transsexual Transylvanian.Jasper feels at home in this theatre, everyone here is a bit of a freak. The next week he prepares a costume but before he can wear it, the cullens have to move again. Jasper packs his costume with the hope that one day he will use it. Imagine if he moves to another town and there’s another cinema with another showing Jasper of course is the weird kid at school so it takes him a lot to put his costume on again. \\nSince he first saw it he told Alice all about it. That Saturday at 1/4 to midnight they leave. Jasper dressed as Frank, Alice as Columbia. Rocky horror slowly became their thing, whatever town they were in they could always be  the same people for at least a night. Slowly the others started getting interested in why Jasper had so many pairs of fishnets in his washing and one day they rented the vhs for Cullen family film night. \\nRosalie, loving theatrics, was hooked. She loved the idea of Janet. The virgin who was tainted by frank and his wicked ways. Esme really loved the floorshow and started humming Rose Tint My World while out on hunts. Carlisle was dubious, He had never really been one to let go, to let loose. The film made him feel a little uncomfortable but he loved seeing the side of Esme it bought out. He already had a drs coat so could easily contribute to the dressing up box if needed. \\nEmmet the kinky fucker loved the idea of Eddy, the motorbike riding, Saxophone playing punk who came to retrieve his girl but ended up as dinner. He liked the irony of being the meal. He borrowed a leather vest off of one of the punks at school. Edward was hard to convince, He liked the film but didn’t know if dressing like this was the right idea in a new town, they might have to move on due to embarrassment and not their secret for once. He would let his family enjoy this mutual thing they enjoyed but he would not partake.\\n\\nOver the next few weeks, more and more of the cullens  joined Jasper and Alice at their midnight showings. Carlisle eventually joined in but only ever as brad. The local hospital could Not see their head of the ED dressed in drag on a saturday night.\\n\\nSuddenly, it’s halloween 1977, the family are now in Portland.\\nThey’ve been planning their costumes for the halloween showing for Weeks, Alice and rosalie and worked every night for a week sewing skirts and glueing rhinestones. this year they we’re going all out. Jasper was the legendary Frank, in full suspenders and leather lace up corset. Rosalie, and Alice were floorshow Janet, and Columbia, nipples nearly out and feather boas round their arms. Esme, had settled in as Columbia, she liked that she could be sexy and keep a bit to the imagination. Carlisle approved of her outfit, especially on non show nights when she would sometimes suprise him in his office. Emmett was Eddie, Scar, Leather and even a real saxophone, Rosalie had to convince him for three solid days that it was less than a good idea for him to show up on a real motorcycle too.\\nCarlisle as always went for preppy plain old Brad Majors, he oh so wanted to join his wife in dressing up, he quite liked the look of Floorshow Rocky, the corset tight against his cold skin. but he had a reputation to uphold. \\nThat night, Alice naturally had turned their entire kitchen into a dressing room, there was make up and glitter, feathers and leather all over the place. Of course the cullens could get ready in  a couple of seconds but they liked the process of having a laugh and getting dressed up together. Jasper could practically do his make up in his sleep. He sprayed his honey curls black and then would move on to help Emmett with the fake blood.\\n\\nEdward watched from the sidelines as his family got ready. he had spent months feeling isolated from the joy this silly little film bought his family. He decided he wanted to go. He headed into the kitchen and made his announcement. Carlisle smiled and helped him get into his costume. This was his opportunity, for one night Carlisle would finally be Rocky. He helped Edward into his Brad costume and then sat and let Alice carefully apply the floor show make up.\\nJasper looked at the clock “okay you freaks, It’s time to go” the coven had learned to leave at least 45 minutes before the showing started. Although they were fast, running in platforms really set them back a bit.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hi everyone!! I was super curious to know where you'd looked to pre-order MS and what had influenced your decision. I think I've seen that in other countries the book is coming with stickers/posters, and in here in the states I've seen book plates (?) or pre-ordering signed copy. What was the deciding factor for you if you pre-ordered? Is there a deal that you thought was worth the money? Did you pre-order with a local bookstore, or straight through the bigger businesses? I've never pre-ordered a book before but I was definitely curious to know what people usually considered when doing so. I showed up to a midnight release for tcc four years ago at B&amp;N and I got it right away. I've pre-ordered an album through the band's website before but I ended up getting to hear it at midnight on the release date on Spotify before getting it in the mail that afternoon and at Target they had the same album with a poster, so it seemed excessive/pointless in retrospect for that specific situation.  \\n\\nSide question/rambling thought:  If the books are getting stocked at different stores, will people be able to buy them at midnight?  I would assume you'd have to wait for morning on the release date what with current events, but I was still wondering if there was anyone living in an area where these larger stores were still closing late/ opening early and able to get the book at midnight like back then. I know the tour's been cancelled, and stores would be strongly dissuaded/prohibited depending on the area to hold any sort of event, so maybe they'd just be casually stocked or something. That B&amp;N event was definitely packed!! When I was younger, I remember for some unrelated but really lucky reason being at Target/ Wal-Mart (pretty sure it was W-M) late at night and seeing the copies of an edition of Harry Potter (maybe OotP?) ready for their release later that following morning, but staying at the store late enough to grab a copy at midnight and there weren't a lot of people there! I remember that happening at Sam's Club for the Deathly Hallows. \\n\\nI just think this is super fascinating and exciting so I had to ask since it's been a long time since there's been so much hype around pre-ordering a highly anticipated book!! Very nostalgic for that. Thanks everyone!!\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I don’t know how to phase this to be able to google it so hopefully a few other people are retreading the series as closely as I am. \\n\\nMy question is based of the first part of chapter 7 of twilight. In it Bella is dreaming about Jacob, Mike and Edward. I’m assuming these three represents the three options her life could take at this point. In the dream Jacob is pulling on her hand, then disappears and is replaced by a reddish brown wolf (which we know in new moon that that’s what he looks like as a wolf). This is followed by Edward stepping into the sun and “glowing” (which we know later that he does in fact glow when exposed to sunlight). \\n\\nSo my question is, if Bella is able to dream so accurately, why does that not manifest into some kind of future telling ability like Alice (since we find out later that before she was turned Alice may have had visions of some kind and was locked in a psych ward by her family where she was kept in a dark room). We do know that Bella’s ability as a shield were greatly increased once she was turned so why was this future seeing ability forgotten about?\\n\\nShe again has dreams in breaking dawn of a child who looks like a mix of Edward and Bella right before she found out she was actually pregnant. Though those dreams didn’t come completely true since she was dreaming of a male child and had renesme instead. \\n\\nThoughts? Maybe something SM thought of early on and then dismissed because the shield thing was more powerful? Did she just forget about it? Has this been addressed already?',\n",

       "   'selftext': '*It is our last week before the movie discussion, which means we are a little over one week from Midnight Sun!  Thank you for coming along for the ride this summer - I hope that you have enjoyed this reread as much as I have. If you have any comments questions or concerns as to how the reread was carried out, please let me know so I can fold it into the readings going forward.*\\n\\n**MARGARET\\'S REVIEW** \\\\- Bella is in the midst of a breakdown when Edward returns. She confesses to asking Jacob to kiss her, and is horrified to find that Edward is understanding, and trying to comfort her. She wants anger, wants jealousy, and he is giving her kindness. He tells her that he knows that she loves him, and she vows that she loves Edward more, something he already knew. Desperate to prove herself, Bella tries to make love to Edward right there in the clearing, but Edward stops her, not wanting their first time to be a frantic act in the middle of the forest. \\n\\nThe fight starts, and Edward narrates what is happening to Bella. Everything is running smoothly, and Seth and Edward lightly bond, when Victoria and Riley, her year old vampire companion, arrive. Bella had been right - Victoria had created the army to come after and kill her. The scent items had been for them, and Riley\\'s was the unfamiliar scent that had been in her bedroom.\\n\\nEdward takes on Victoria as Seth takes on Riley. Bella watches Edward truly slip into vamp mode for the first time as she watches him fight, her back against a cliff face. Edward and Victoria circle each other, with Edward picking thoughts out of her mind to twist them and keep her off balance, when Riley deals a significant blow to Seth. Bella grabs a sharp rock and moves to slice open her wrist in an attempt to sacrifice herself to distract Victoria and Riley a la the Third Wife, and the fight picks up. Edward sees what she is attempting, and makes quick work of destroying Riley and then Victoria, with Seth helping him in the blitz. The fight ends with Edward ripping off Victoria\\'s head with a primal snarl. \\n\\nBella is frozen, rock still in hand, staring at Edward. He turns slowly, concerned that he had finally scared Bella off in his display of violence. He convinces Bella to drop the rock, and she runs to him, so grateful that he is safe. Seth is a bit roughed up, but mostly recovered from the feint, and the trio go to the clearing, where the battle is done. Alice has foreseen the Volturi arriving now, at the end of the battle, to see what has happened. Edward tells Bella that Jacob was injured saving Leah, and Bella faints. When she awakes in the clearing, Carlisle assures her that Jacob will be alright, he just needs time to heal. One of the newborns, named Bree, is surrounded by the family - Carlisle had decided to spare her life, but she was struggling to not go after Bella when she was this close. \\n\\nJane and Felix of the Volturi arrive. They are shocked that the Cullens had wiped out the army on their own, not knowing that the pack exist. Jane attempts to use her power on Bella again, and fails again, much to her frustration. Jane reminds them of Bella\\'s need to be turned, and the Cullens confirm that it is imminent. Felix kills Bree against Carlisle and Esme\\'s protests, as it is their policy to kill every single member of a newborn army. They leave, clearly disappointed that the Cullens has survived so clearly unscathed. \\n\\nThey return to Forks, and Edward and Carlisle go to La Push to help treat Jacob. Bella is haunted by the image of Bree, and she asks Alice if she will be like that when she turns. Alice admits that the desperation for blood will most likely be there for her first couple of years, but that she has no idea how Bella preparing before her transformation will affect her newborn years. \\n\\nCharlie comes home from La Push, and tells Bella that everyone was acting strangely, and then Edward and Carlisle had arrived carrying Jacob, who was injured from a motorcycle accident. Charlie finally sees some good in Edward in how he was so gentle and careful with Jacob, and he accepts that Edward is who Bella is meant to be with. He can feel that he is going to lose Bella soon, although he does not know why, and he asks her to tell him before she runs off with Edward, which she shakily agrees to, not wanting him to know how much his acceptance means to her. \\n\\nBella goes to visit Jacob once Carlisle is done setting almost every bone in his body. Jacob is awake, and annoyed that Edward played the nice guy after his assault - he had thought that it would finally be enough to push Edward away so Bella would run to him. Bella knows Edward isn\\'t like that, and finally finds herself secure in his love, no longer expecting him to leave her again. Jacob lets go, and the pair acknowledge that in the normal world, with no vampires and werewolves they could have worked, but in the supernatural world, no one stood a chance at getting between her and Edward. Bella tells Jacob that she is going to turn after she and Edward are married, and Jacob tells her he is going to be waiting in the wings until the moment her heart stops (and maybe even after).\\n\\nBella leaves, and has an emotional breakdown. Not only is she letting go of Jacob, she is letting go of a part of herself. The human part. She lets go of the person who loved Jacob, and who could have been happy with him, in order to let the person who loved Edward and would only be happy with him grow. Edward comes and gets her where she is sobbing on the side of the road, and holds her through the night, silently comforting her as she experiences a tidal wave of grief. It is immense, and as it being to peter off Edward questions if she had made the right decision, if it put her through so much pain. But Bella had been through worse pain before - while she was able to cry out her feelings for Jacob over a night, she had been borderline catatonic for months at the loss of Edward. She loves him, she chooses him, and she is ready to start her eternity with him. \\n\\nThey go to see Alice, and Bella sees the sketch of the wedding dress Alice had designed for her. Bella asks Alice to be her bridesmaid, which thrills Alice, and she bustles off to put wedding planning in turbo mode as they go to their meadow. \\n\\nLying in the meadow, they decide to be married August 13th, a month before Bella\\'s birthday. Bella wants to invite Jacob, but decides against it, not wanting to put him through any more pain. Edward cannot take her self sacrifice, and attempts to make love to Bella in the clearing, not wanting her to marry him on conditions, and wanting her to have everything she wants, no holds barred, but Bella stops him. She sees it from a new perspective now - if she does it in the \"right\" order she leaves Charlie and Renee with some sense of closure - even if she disappears, they will know she is with Edward, and happy. Edward slides his mothers ring on her finger, and they go to tell Charlie that they are engaged. \\n\\nThe Epilogue is from the perspective of Jacob, the first time perspective shifts in the series from Bella. He is healed, and tormented by the idea of Bella with Edward. He receives an invitation to the wedding , and he transforms, and runs to Canada, trying to get as far away as possible.\\n\\n**FUNCTIONAL FACTOID** \\\\- Victoria had quite the complex backstory, which ended up being mostly cut from the novels - I highly recommend reading [her page on the wiki](https://twilightsaga.fandom.com/wiki/Victoria) to get a sense of who she was beyond antagonist. \\n\\n**SUBREDDIT QUESTIONS OF THE WEEK** \\\\- We made it! Eclipse in barely 2 months, a miracle. What are your thoughts on this book? How do you feel about Edward\\'s response to Jacobs final assault? How do you feel about Bella\\'s response? When Bella has her later breakdown, how do you feel about how the two of them handled it? Do you think the \\'final battle\\' lived up to the climax it was built to? How do you feel about Riley and Bree (note - we will be doing a reread of Bree Tanner at some point down the line, possibly this winter)? How do you feel about Charlie now at the end of this book? Thoughts on Edward sending Jacob the invitation to the wedding anyway? How do you feel about Edward\\'s about face in the meadow? Drop any and all thoughts you have left on Eclipse the book here, as next week in the movie, and then it is Midnight Sun time.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So, let me say up front that I actually haven’t even watched BDPrt2 all the way through. I’ve reread the books a million times, but by the time BD came out I was like 17 and deep into my “not like the other girls” phase. So, I’m not a movie stan, and I don’t have a lot of sentimental attachment to them. \\n\\nBut Billy Burke is the best thing about those damn movies. I don’t even really *like* Charlie in the books, he congratulates Jacob for sexually assaulting his daughter, but Billy Burke’s Charlie is so well-acted, and he and Kristen have a great father-daughter dynamic that I really believe. \\n\\nThe other best part is all of Bella’s friends. The casting is perfect, and it’s amazing to hear Anna Kendrick snark. I actually laughed out loud at her little monologue after the movie in New Moon (you know, my cousin had leprosy, it’s not funny!). And the little scene in Eclipse where they’re talking about Jess’ valedictorian speech is also hilarious, and reminded me so much of actual kids in high school. They’re all brilliant. I saw the Angela scene in the extended edition for the first time today, and it was wonderful - I can’t believe they cut it! - I really think all of them should have played bigger roles to add some levity. Plus I just love Anna Kendrick. \\n\\nSo that’s my spiel. I think the reason that I don’t require Charlie/the school kids to be that way in the books is because Edward and Bella aren’t blocks of wood like they are in the movie, and the Cullens all have actual personalities and provide levity themselves without being awkward. Truly, the books are so much better. \\n\\nEnd rant.',\n",

Okay. So take a baseball bat and stud it with vampire teeth, or make a serrated vampire-tooth blade. Load a blunderbuss with vampire teeth. Or just use weapons designed to incapacitate rather than kill. Vampire strength is great, but not infinite; I doubt they could break a carbon-fiber net or bola, especially if their arms were pinned. Tasers should affect them, if Kate's power does.\\n\\nThat's not even getting into the high-tech possibilities, like incendiary rounds tipped with vampire-tooth enamel, or, hell, *flamethrowers*. Predator drones, if we're thinking big. Aro even has a line in *Breaking Dawn* to the effect that human technology has advanced to the point of being able to threaten vampires -- yet vampires don't think to use it themselves?\\n\\nOne explanation is that vampires find it hard to adapt to modernity; fine as far as it goes, but they have no problem with cars, computers, and cell phones. Flamethrowers have been around since WWII.\\n\\nAnyone know if SM was ever asked this question? I haven't looked at many interviews or supplementary materials.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Okay so I only just joined the sub but I’ve been in love with these books and movies since I was 8 and after doing a rewatch of the series yesterday I realised there still questions I can’t find answers to. Some of them are movie questions and others are general plot questions. If anyone found these answers somewhere I wasn’t looking, pls let me know. \\n\\nFirst, I know Edward got bella knocked up because his venom allows so, but female vampires aren’t able to get pregnant with the same concept? Like if edward’s venom acted as his fluids, shouldn’t a female’s be able to as well? Also, some online said they can’t get preggo because their stone skin can’t expand for the baby, but wouldn’t that mean a male couldn’t get a boner? \\n\\nMy next question is pretty simple..how did Bella suddenly have makeup when she turned after having renesmee? Like after her cheeks filled in and her hair returned to a healthy state, how did this transformation give her makeup? This might just be a movie thing that only nitpickers would notice, but I can’t help but feel like it’s a bit silly. \\n\\nNext, renesmee and Jacob. I feel like it’s canon that they end up being together together. Since she is half human with blood, I assume she will be able to become pregnant. If she births a son, wouldn’t this mean the son would be not only a vampire/human, but also potentially a wolf descendant? How would that work? (Would love a book about this happening Stephanie PLS)\\n\\nLastly, suicidal vampires. As we know, vampires can be burned to die, so why did Edward do all that dramatic Volturi walking in the sun thing when he could’ve just stepped in a bonfire? \\n\\nThere’s other random questions, like why Stephanie didn’t include Alice’s incredibly sad backstory or Jane’s potential backstory (who imo has the most interesting power) in the books, etc..but these aren’t really questions the community would have answers to. Having just pre-ordered midnight sun, I’d love to discuss some of these questions with yall. I feel it would be nice, especially as someone who doesn’t have any irl people who enjoy the series. :)',\n",

And in breaking dawn part 1 &amp; 2 I felt it really showed us a different side. In the book she felt like a loving concerned family member who wanted to be there for Bella and Renesmee but in the movie she felt a little more... heartless. Like when Bella was dying yes they all left because of her blood being an issue but the movie seemed to make her very baby oriented like she was only helping Bella to get to her baby. \\n\\nI just felt like it really nullified her character and completely axed any depth she had as she was just BABY BABY BABY centered. The books she just felt so much more heartfelt and caring. I will say I was happy to see Rosalie get to be that aunt and mother style figure because we know she genuinely really wanted a family. It makes me just wish she could have had her own child ya know?',\n",

       "   'selftext': '**Twilight**\\n1. Bella/Edward, as a couple and as individuals: Bella and Edward could be polarizing characters. Throughout books 2-4, their predominant qualities were quite negative, which made them either difficult to root for or difficult to relate to in my opinion. By *Eclipse*, they were behaving at their worst, much like some of the other characters were as well (e.g. Jacob and Alice). In the first book of the saga, though, said qualities were not as prevalent, and their most promising traits were on display; Bella showed a fair amount of independence and was at her bravest and most selfless during the climax of the book, and Edward was funnier and more carefree than in any other book in the series. Their relationship was at its best as well. *Twilight* was when they first met and became attracted to each other, and it was when we - as readers - could experience the intrigue and mystery they presented to one another. Edward was absent for most of *New Moon*, and they spent much of *Eclipse* fighting and being rather awful to each other. And for most of *Breaking Dawn*, Edward was somewhat of a side character in his own love story. \\n2. Tone of book: The first book in the series was somewhat gothic in tone; there was an air of dark romance and sinister mystery to it that was not as present in the following installments. Despite Bella’s disinterest in viewing Edward as anything but perfect, the text and subtext made it clear that Edward was deeply troubled and struggled with the monster within. *Twilight* maintained that their dark and intense romance could lead to consequences fitting of a complicated human/vampire romance. Personally, I thought that the ending of *Life and Death* matched the tone of *Twilight* more so than the ending of *Breaking Dawn*. \\n3. Villain: In many cases, more complex or emotionally-driven villains - or ones with more extensive backstories - are the best villains. In this saga’s case, though, the simplest villain was my favorite amongst the antagonists. Unlike Victoria and the Volturi, James was actually able to get his hands on Bella and came the closest to achieving his objective with her. He was evil for the fun of it - not due to a desire for vengeance or power - and that element of his character worked in the story’s favor. \\n4. Climax: The plot that led to the climax of the series’ first installment did not even start until 75% into the book, but it produced the most intense climax amongst the four novels. Unlike the other books - where the protagonist had a band of supernatural protectors between her and her foes - Bella faced the enemy alone and sustained a fair amount of damage. The severity of the situation was felt during Bella’s insistence to ensure that Charlie was protected, the pacing of those last handful of chapters was done well, and consequences of human/vampire relations were substantiated more fiercely. \\n\\n**New Moon**\\n1. Jacob’s character: Jacob went through the most monumental change during the course of the saga. In *Twilight*, he was more of a plot convenience than a character in his own right. In *New Moon*, though, he became one of the story’s most prominent characters and was at his best as a character. He was friendly, happy, easy-going, fun, and warm. Bella had an emotional and spiritual connection with him that the reader could see play out across the pages, and she referred to him as her “Sun”, a kindred spirit, and someone who knew her better than anyone else. Even after his transformation, the reader could sympathize with the pain and fear he was experiencing during the latter half of the book. Similarly to Bella and Edward, his character was at his worst in *Eclipse* and met an unfortunate end in *Breaking Dawn*. While I was still interested in reading about his character, he never returned to his former greatness in *New Moon*. Before the last two novels, I would have considered Jacob one of the best characters in the series. \\n\\n**Eclipse**\\n1. Backstories: The backstories of the supporting characters were some of the best elements of the saga, and certain backstories - the best ones in my opinion - were a significant part of this book. Rosalie and Jasper were two of my favorite characters and had the most interesting backstories, so the focus on them was an enjoyable aspect of *Eclipse.* And aside from imprinting - one of my least favorite elements of the story - the wolf pack legends and the pack’s overall structure were some of the best parts of the series, and they were featured heavily in Book 3.\\n2. Character interactions: In *Twilight*, the book focused the most on just Bella and Edward. The other Cullens were mostly featured at the end, and the Quileutes were barely featured at all. *New Moon* consisted of mostly Bella/Jacob scenes, with some Bella/Cullen scenes at the beginning and end of the book. *Eclipse*, however, showcased more interactions between the supporting characters that were not as present in the previous installments; it displayed both the Cullens and the Quileutes quite heavily throughout - interacting amongst themselves, with each other, and with Bella. *Breaking Dawn* followed in the previous book’s footsteps in this regard, but the character interactions weren’t as compelling. \\n3. Plot: This book’s plot was the strongest amongst the four, and it was introduced as early as the first chapter. Compared to the other three, *Eclipse’s* main story was the most streamlined. This book, also, wrapped up most of the plot threads and storylines of the first three books. \\n4. Themes of book: There were a number of themes explored in this series - obsession, temptation, desperation, instability...During the final book, many of the main themes felt distorted and reached an unsatisfying resolution. The third book, though, explored the most intriguing themes of the series and allowed them to carry real weight. One such theme was humanity vs. immortality. Bella’s desire to become a vampire was an ever-present storyline throughout all four books, but it was not until *Eclipse* when Bella comprehended the consequences of her choice. Rosalie’s backstory presented her with the value of humanity, Jasper’s past informed her of the darkest aspects of vampirism, and her potential life with Jacob made her appreciate what she would lose. While she was never swayed from her decision, she was more informed about it. \\n\\n**Breaking Dawn**\\n1. Different perspectives: Aside from the epilogue of *Eclipse,* this book was the only story in the saga that incorporated more than one character point of view. Meyer’s greatest strength as a writer is her ability to allow the audience to feel as part of the story themselves (i.e. truly feeling like they are inside the character’s head), and this ability was demonstrated even further with Jacob’s POV chapters. Not only was I able to experience the story in Jacob’s head, but I could appreciate the different narrative voices of Bella and Jacob; they truly felt like different character perspectives. And the POV change was one of the most interesting aspects of both the book and the series as a whole. \\n2. Side characters: In the previous three installments, side characters were sparse, flat, and of little importance to anything else going on in the story. This final book, however, incorporated compelling side characters that expanded the series’ world and supernatural lore, despite said characters’ brief appearances in the story. Kate, Garrett, Benjamin, and the Romanians were fascinating, and J. Jenks provided an interesting side-plot that explored the position of a human who hovered on the edge of the vampire world. \\n\\nWhat would you consider the strongest elements of each novel?',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hello all. Please see the below changes which we have made after receiving community feedback, as well as engaging with other moderators about how best to facilitate good and constructive discussions in subreddits.\\n\\n----\\n\\n###Meme-kends\\n\\nMeme-kends, the period from 6am UTC Saturday to 6am UTC Mondays where memes were allowed to be posted, has been removed. People felt this was too limiting and that while memes may be of low quality, they are enjoyable nonetheless. As such you can now post memes whenever.\\n\\nTo ensure that posts, but in particular memes, are not spammed, we are also reemphasising the posting frequency limits. See below.\\n\\n###Posting frequency limits\\n\\nWhen meme-kends were introduced, we introduced an automatic rule that meant you could not submit more than 3 posts in 24 hours. We have reworked this rule so that now you can make *2 posts per 12 hours*. Based on our monitoring of submissions since instituting meme-kends, we rarely saw someone who made more than 2 posts per 12 hours. As such, we feel this is a good number to simultaneously encourage discussion while disallowing the potential for spam. This will be monitored and altered as needed, particularly following Midnight Sun's release.\\n\\nPlease note a 'post' is a submission, not a comment; you can make as many comments (within reason) as needed per 12 hours.\\n\\n###Rules updates\\n\\nDuplicate posts are now mentioned in rule #3, civility and quality. If you spot a duplicate post, please report it under this rule (or utilising the *Other* custom report option).\\n\\n###Reminder: FAQs\\n\\nWe have a link to frequently asked questions in the sidebar. https://www.reddit.com//r/twilight/wiki/twilight-faqs \\n\\nPlease ensure you read these before submitting a new post, as such posts are considered duplicates/spam.\\n\\nIf you come across one of these posts, please also report it so it can be removed.\\n\\n----\\n\\nWe are happy to answer any questions below.\\n\\nThank you for your patience and understanding.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Alright....I’m just gonna say it, this guy should’ve been handled differently.\\n\\nNow before anyone agrees about SMeyer assassinating his character to make Edward look like a better choice (something that I had believed for a while up until a few months ago), she did not. In fact she did everything in line what his character would do after the end of New Moon. My issue is that I wish she didn’t have to go with such extremes with his character if she wanted us to sympathise with Bella on what she could be missing if she didn’t go for him. His behaviour makes sense since the end of New Moon because: he never wanted to be a shapeshifter, never wanted to be an alpha, he never wanted to give up his hopes and dreams so that he can spend eternity combatting vampires in a war he never asked to be a part of, and he certainly hated the idea that the girl he loved was about to be turned into the very thing he was programmed to destroy. He’s a free-spirit that wanted to forge his own destiny.\\n\\nSo him trying to convince Bella at the beginning of Eclipse to not be a vampire and his overall bitterness makes sense, because he wanted to save her and by extension himself from meeting a fate where he would be forced to destroy her and live with the pain forever. The treaty clearly stated that if one of the Cullens bites a human, the treaty is over, regardless of the human’s consent or not. Also his love for Bella is also the one thing that he believes he still has some semblance of control over, something that was his from his previous life that hadn’t been robbed by the grips of the supernatural world. He spends his time trying to convince her that she’s in love with him and not Edward because he knows how vampires work - they can lure people with their voices, their smell and their physical features, so to him he thinks that Bella’s being mind-controlled. It’s only during the tent scene does he realise that Bella’s love for Edward is genuine and that Edward in fact wanted the best for her this entire time, is what causes him to reel out of control.\\n\\nThese are elements of his character that could’ve been used to gain sympathy from us as an audience in Eclipse by having Bella trying to understand Jacob and where he was coming from. If you read his perspective on Twilight and New Moon on SMeyer’s website, it gives you an indication of how much of fleshed out and more complicated character Jacob was, and why he acted the way he did at the beginning OMG Eclipse. However, the moment when he sexually assaults Bella and then manipulates her into kissing him just to confess that she loved him is where all form of redemption is thrown out the window for his character unfortunately, and turned Jacob into arguably one of the most - if not THE most - hated character across the fandom. His bitterness at the beginning of Eclipse makes sense but I wish SMeyer delved deeper into his pain to make us feel torn just as Bella was, instead of having him do the things that he does later on in the book that in turn made him very dislikable to people. \\n\\nI’m still on Team Jacob by the way, but she didn’t need to go that far with his character. Because even when she tried convincing people that he’s not a bad person, those two things are so glaringly bad that it’s understandable why there’s so much Jacob hate on this sub and across the fandom - especially with the era we’re living in now.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Harry Potter, one of the BIGGEST franchises and  fandoms of all time (Besides Twilight) receives almost no negative attention; also, Divergent, Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, you name it. All of these things are fairly childlike reads that are meant to be consumed by children/teens yet they all receive a good amount of respect, even if they aren’t that good (I’m looking at you Divergent). I’ve been thinking about this because with Midnight Sun coming out, I’m obviously going to be posting about it on my social media, and I’m nervous because I will SURELY get hate from some people for liking Twilight. It’s RIDICULOUS. The books drew in a bunch of girls and older women (dubbed twimoms) and it instantly became “Stupid” because of that. It just pisses me off and will always upset me.
